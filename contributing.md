# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Nextwind! Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting a pull request**.

## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create [a feature request](https://github.com/awsmakshay/nextwind/discussions/new?category=ideas) to first discuss any significant new ideas.

Submit a PR to `develop` branch

So far you should have pushed your work to your feature branch and have tested that it works on your device. Then final step is to open a pull request to the `develop` branch
